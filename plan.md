# Development Plan: Camper Trip Website for GitLab Pages
**Created:** August 2, 2025  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Project:** Camper Trip Website Deployment

## Task 1: Requirements Analysis

### Objective
Analyze the business requirements for creating a website based on the road trip guide in idea.md and deploy it to GitLab Pages.

### Business Context
**Problem Solved:** Create an accessible, web-based version of the comprehensive camping trip guide for southern France, making it easier for families to access, navigate, and use during trip planning and execution.

**Users:** 
- Primary: Families planning camping trips to southern France
- Secondary: Travel enthusiasts, camping community members

**Business Impact:**
- Improved accessibility of travel information
- Better user experience compared to markdown format
- Potential for wider reach and sharing
- Foundation for future travel guide websites

### Technical Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
- Convert markdown content to responsive web format
- Preserve all travel information, including:
  - Itineraries and route planning
  - Camping site recommendations
  - Regulatory information (Crit'Air vignette, documentation)
  - Family-friendly activities and locations
  - Equipment checklists
- Interactive features:
  - Navigation menu for different sections
  - Search functionality for locations/activities
  - Mobile-responsive design
  - Print-friendly styling

#### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Fast loading times suitable for mobile data usage while traveling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for inclusive access
- **SEO**: Proper meta tags and structured data for search engine visibility
- **Offline Capability**: Consideration for PWA features for offline access
- **Deployment**: Must be compatible with GitLab Pages static hosting

### Dependencies
- GitLab repository access and CI/CD pipeline configuration
- No external APIs or databases required (static content only)
- Image assets from the original guide (if any)

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Website displays all content from idea.md in organized, navigable format
- [x] Fully responsive design works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [x] Deploys successfully to GitLab Pages with custom domain support
- [x] Load time under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- [x] Search functionality for finding specific locations or activities
- [x] Print stylesheet for offline reference

## Task 2: Technical Design

### Architecture Approach
**Static Site Generation:** Following platform standards for simplicity and performance, using vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a lightweight static site generator.

**Domain Boundaries:** Single-domain website focusing on travel content presentation without complex business logic or user management.

### Data Model
**Content Structure:**
- Landing page with overview
- Section pages for:
  - Regulatory requirements (documents, Crit'Air vignette)
  - Itinerary A: Heart of Occitania (7 days)
  - Itinerary B: Pyrenees to Mediterranean (7 days)
  - Camping sites and service areas
  - Equipment checklist
  - Additional resources and references

**Navigation Schema:**
```

│   ├── Documentation Requirements
│   ├── Crit'Air Vignette Process
│   └── August Travel Tips
├── Itineraries
│   ├── Route A: Heart of Occitania

```

### Technology Stack
**Recommended Approach:**
- **Framework:** Hugo static site generator (fast, reliable, good GitLab Pages support)
- **Alternative:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS if Hugo adds unnecessary complexity
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout
- **Search:** Client-side search with Fuse.js for offline capability
- **Build Process:** GitLab CI/CD with Hugo or simple copy operation

### Integration Points
- GitLab Pages hosting platform
- Custom domain configuration (if required)
- Google Analytics (optional for usage tracking)

## Task 3: Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-2)
- Set up GitLab repository structure
- Configure GitLab Pages CI/CD pipeline
- Create basic HTML structure and navigation
- Implement responsive CSS framework

#### Phase 2: Content Migration (Days 3-4)
- Convert markdown sections to HTML pages
- Structure content with proper headings and semantic markup
- Add cross-references and internal linking
- Implement basic search functionality

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (Days 5-6)
- Add interactive features (maps, image galleries)
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Implement print stylesheets
- Performance optimization

#### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Day 7)
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance testing
- Content review and proofreading
- Final deployment to GitLab Pages

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** JavaScript functionality (search, navigation)
- **Integration Tests:** Full page rendering and cross-references
- **E2E Tests:** User journey through different travel scenarios
- **Performance Tests:** Page load times, mobile usability
- **Accessibility Tests:** Screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation

### Deployment Plan
- **Development:** Feature branch deployment for testing
- **Staging:** Main branch automatic deployment to staging URL
- **Production:** Manual deployment trigger to custom domain (if applicable)
- **Rollback Strategy:** Git-based rollback with automatic redeployment

### Risk Assessment
- **Content Volume Risk:** Large content might slow initial load
  - *Mitigation:* Progressive loading, content optimization
- **Mobile Performance Risk:** Complex layouts may not work on all devices
  - *Mitigation:* Mobile-first design approach, thorough device testing
- **GitLab Pages Limitations:** Static hosting constraints
  - *Mitigation:* Design within static site capabilities, no server-side features
